# Ski Navigation in Solden

Help! I keep getting lost during wintersport vacation and my friends have trouble finding me. Pleae help me build a SPA application (using tanstack router, query) that can help me solve these problems.
For context:
1. We are in Solden
2. I continuously share my location data with Google Maps as well as with Garmin and Strava

As a start I'd like us to build an application that can easily help us navigate the pistes:
Let's say most of my friends are at the start of the Giggijoch piste and I am at the Gaislachkogl. I'd like this app to be able to show me how to navigat to the Giggijoch piste. It should allow me to filter pistes by color (blue, red, black) so that If I'm tired I can choose the easiest slopes.
It would be great if we could visualize this in 3D space (I guess using r3f).

Later I would also like to visualize my own runs by uploading my garmin data. And perhaps it might even be fun if we could auto generate some videos based on the 3D visualization using remotion (it allows to do all of this client side)

Let's start building a plan for this application.
